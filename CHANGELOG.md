1.1.0
-----

##### Features

 * Added attribute `app:cv_max_height="${dimension}"` to make the ChipView's content scrollable beyond this limit (fixes [\#8](https://github.com/DoodleScheduling/android-material-chips/issues/8))
 * Added attribute `app:cv_vertical_spacing="${dimension}"` to allow configurable spacing between rows (fixes [\#4](https://github.com/DoodleScheduling/android-material-chips/issues/4))
 
##### Misc

 * Added `getChips()` (fixes [\#6](https://github.com/DoodleScheduling/android-material-chips/issues/6))
 * Added `getEditText()`, e.g. to allow the ChipsView to be made non-editable (fixes [\#2](https://github.com/DoodleScheduling/android-material-chips/issues/2))
 * Improved the cursor's alignment to be centered towards the Chips in its row
 * Improved the sample application
 
##### Upgrade Notes

As the ChipsView itself is now a ScrollView you may want to remove any ScrollView that you already used to wrap the ChipView's content and use `app:cv_max_height` instead.
